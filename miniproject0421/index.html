            <h4 >It is based on a photo I took from the 24th floor of Jingyao dormitory at dusk. The view from our dorm is great, we are able to see the Huangpu River at a distance as well as some blocks of green plants nearby. Hence, this drawing basically depicts the sky, the river and the green plants blocks.</h4>
